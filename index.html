  <h5 class='title'> 18 years old - San Francisco Native <br>Currently studying Computer Science (B.S) '19 at the University of California, San Diego.</h5>
  <p>I enjoy uncluttered, simplistic designs and try my best to model my work as such.</p>
  <p> My path to computer science was a surprising one, at least to me. I was well on my way to become an electrical engineer before I took a programming course my first quarter of college. Needless to say it changed everything. Six computer science courses later, I applied to switch into the major and got in!</p>
  <p>When I'm not studying and programming for my degree, I look to spend my time learning about different aspects of programming not covered in class. At my college, there isn't a heavy focus on web development, which is how I ended up creating this website.</p>
    <p>I'm not quite certain which aspect of computer science I enjoy most and want to focus on more, so I'm dabbling in all aspects until I have a better idea.</p>
    <p>The times when I'm not trying to make my code function, I enjoy playing basketball/volleyball, talking with friends, reading, playing tetris(yeah yeah, real old school, I know), backing KickStarter projects, and power napping.</p>
